* **Invoice Generation:** Create new invoices, specifying customer, products, and quantities.
* **Invoice Tracking:** View, search, and filter existing invoices.
* **Reporting:** Generate reports on sales, revenue, etc. (Future Enhancement)
* **Data Persistence:**  All data is stored in a SQL database for reliability and consistency.

## Technologies Used

* **Python:** Programming language for application logic and user interface.
* **SQL:** Database language for data storage and retrieval. (Specify database used: e.g., SQLite, PostgreSQL, MySQL)
* **(Optional) GUI Framework:** (e.g., Tkinter, PyQt, Kivy) If a GUI is used, mention it here.
* **(Optional) Database Connector:** (e.g., `sqlite3`, `psycopg2`, `mysql.connector`) The Python library used to interact with the database.

## Installation

2. **Install dependencies:** `pip install -r requirements.txt` (If you have a `requirements.txt` file)
3. **Set up the database:**
    * Create a new database (if necessary).
    * Configure the database connection details in the Python code. (Provide instructions on how to do this - e.g., config file, environment variables).
4. **Run the application:** `python main.py` (Or the appropriate command to run your main script.
